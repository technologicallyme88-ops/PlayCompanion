# Study: your Anki decks on the reader

Study is a flashcard app that behaves like a real Anki client. It reads a deck
converted from your own Anki collection, schedules reviews with the same FSRS
algorithm and the same parameters Anki uses, and syncs every review back so
Anki (and AnkiWeb) treat them exactly as if you had done them on your phone.

No editing, no audio. Everything else -- adding cards, retraining FSRS,
browsing -- happens in Anki, where those things are good. The card can hold
several decks; the deck screen switches between them.

## The no-terminal way

The site has an installer page: **[crossplay.ma-r-s.com/study](https://crossplay.ma-r-s.com/study/)**.
Export your deck from Anki (`File > Export`, .apkg, scheduling included),
drop it on the page, see your own cards running on the emulated device, and
write the deck to the SD card -- then, after studying, the same page replays
your reviews back into your Anki collection. Everything happens in the tab;
nothing is uploaded anywhere. The page runs the exact tools documented
below, so the two routes cannot disagree; the command line remains the power
tool, and the only route that pushes to AnkiWeb itself.

## What you need (the command-line way)

- **The tools.** They live in this repository, not in the firmware: clone it
  (or download it as a zip from the same place you got the firmware) and run
  everything below from the repository root. Nothing needs to be installed
  from it -- the scripts run in place.
- Anki installed on this computer, with the deck you want to study. A deck
  downloaded from AnkiWeb's shared decks counts: import it into Anki first,
  and it converts like any other.
- The reader's SD card, mounted (or any directory, for a look around).
- Python 3. Everything else installs itself into a private environment
  (`.venv-study/`) the first time it is needed; nothing touches your system
  Python.

## First time: put a deck on the card

```bash
./tools_local/study/study.py setup
```

That is the whole command. It finds your Anki collection, lists your decks,
finds the SD card, and asks one question for each. Then it converts the deck,
builds fonts if the deck needs them, and packs any sentence images. Answers are
remembered in `~/.config/crosspoint-study.json`, so the next run asks nothing.

Put the card in the reader: **Apps > STUDY**.

Run setup again to put another deck on the card -- adding alongside is the
default, replacing is offered. On the reader, the `DECK 1/2` row on the deck
screen cycles between them, and the reader remembers which one you had open.
Each deck keeps its own scheduling state, review log, stats and fonts.

Every prompt has a flag (`--collection`, `--deck`, `--to`, `--name`, `--add`,
`--replace`), so the command is scriptable once you know your answers.

### Which decks convert

Any deck whose note type the converter understands, which is nearly all of
them:

- **Stock "Basic"** (and "Basic (and reversed card)", where each direction
  becomes its own card): first field is the word, second is the meaning.
- **Any homemade note type**: same rule, first field and second field. The
  converter prints the mapping it chose; if it guessed wrong, name the fields
  yourself:

  ```bash
  ./tools_local/study/study.py setup --map headword=Word --map reading=Pronunciation
  ```

  Slots: `headword`, `reading`, `meaning`, `partOfSpeech`, `sentence`,
  `sentenceReading`, `sentenceMeaning`.

- **HSK / HSK+ / Basic+** have full built-in profiles (all seven slots).
- **Cloze decks do not convert.** The front of a cloze card is text with a
  hole in it, and this card format has nowhere to put a hole. Cloze stays in
  Anki.

The supported scripts are English (anything the built-in Latin face covers)
and Chinese. Other scripts -- Korean, Arabic, Cyrillic and the rest -- are out
of scope: nothing stops the converter, but nobody has made the fonts or the
text layout right for them, and setup will warn about every character the
built-in face cannot draw rather than pretend.

Scheduling state comes along: a card due in 21 days in Anki is due in 21 days
on the reader, with the same stability and difficulty. New decks start fresh,
exactly as they would in Anki.

### Fonts

- **A Chinese deck** needs real CJK faces. The converter builds
  them from the TTFs in your Anki media folder -- `_simsun.ttf`, `_simhei.ttf`,
  `_msyahei.ttf`, `_kaiti.ttf`, `_fangsong.ttf` -- and the reader randomises
  the typeface per card, which stops you learning the shape of one font instead
  of the character. Ship whichever of the five you have; the reader uses what
  it finds.
- **Any other deck** needs nothing: the built-in serif draws it. Setup offers
  to build a large headword face from a font your system already has (Georgia
  on a Mac); accept and the type looks right with no further thought. To pick
  your own face, hand it any TTF -- and `--no-font` skips the question:

  ```bash
  ./tools_local/study/study.py setup --font ~/Fonts/Georgia.ttf
  ```

  The size is fitted to the deck: the face is built as large as the longest
  word allows, so an English deck's `incontrovertible` fits where a Chinese
  deck's four characters would.

- A card whose text the installed fonts cannot draw falls back to the built-in
  face on its own, per card. A wrong font install can look plain; it cannot
  look blank.

## After every session: sync

```bash
./tools_local/study/study.py sync
```

Quit Anki first (two writers is how a collection gets corrupted; the tool
checks and refuses). Every review you did on the reader -- across every deck on
the card -- is replayed into your collection: same grades, same timestamps,
same revlog entries Anki itself would have written. A backup of the collection
is made first. Reviews you undid on the reader are skipped -- as far as Anki
learns, they never happened. With `--ankiweb` the push happens once, after all
decks have replayed.

Add flags for the two common extras:

```bash
./tools_local/study/study.py sync --ankiweb --reconvert
```

- `--ankiweb` pushes the updated collection to AnkiWeb afterwards, using
  Anki's own sync client. Credentials come from `$ANKI_USERNAME` /
  `$ANKI_PASSWORD` or a prompt; they are used for the login call and never
  stored or logged. The sync library installs itself into the tooling venv on
  first use.
- `--reconvert` refreshes every deck on the card afterwards, so new cards you
  added in Anki, edits, and re-optimised FSRS parameters all reach the reader.
  Fonts that no longer cover a grown deck are rebuilt on the spot.
- `--dry-run` reports what would change and writes nothing.

`./tools_local/study/study.py status` shows what is configured and how many
reviews are waiting to sync.

## The loop, in full

1. Study on the reader. Reviews are written to the card after every answer, so
   a dead battery loses nothing.
2. `study.py sync` when you are back at the computer.
3. In Anki, study other decks, add cards, or run
   **Deck options > Optimize FSRS parameters** whenever Anki suggests it -- your
   reader reviews count toward the optimisation like any others.
4. `study.py sync --reconvert` (or plain `setup` again) carries new cards and
   new parameters back to the card.

There is no wall: the reader is a full citizen of your Anki ecosystem, not an
export.

## On the reader

- Tap anywhere to reveal the answer; tap AGAIN / HARD / GOOD / EASY to grade.
  The times on the buttons are computed the same way Anki computes them.
- **UNDO** (footer, question side) takes back the last answer -- one level,
  during the session.
- **PHOTO** (header, answer side) shows the card's sentence image full screen,
  when it has one. Tap to come back.
- The deck screen shows the last two weeks, today's due count, retention, and
  the streak.

## When something looks wrong

| Symptom                                  | Cause and fix                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "No deck on the card yet" on the reader  | The card has no converted deck. Run `study.py setup`.                                                                                           |
| A headword draws in the small plain face | The installed fonts cannot draw that card, so it fell back. Re-run `setup` (it rebuilds fonts that no longer cover the deck), or pass `--font`. |
| `no convertible cards` during setup      | Cloze-only deck, or a note type whose first field is empty. Use `--map` to name the right fields.                                               |
| Sync says Anki is running                | Quit Anki and re-run. `--force` exists but means two writers.                                                                                   |
| Word and meaning came out swapped        | The converter guessed fields by order. Re-run setup with `--map headword=... --map meaning=...`.                                                |
| Reviews look doubled in Anki             | They cannot: replay is keyed by review timestamp, and rows that already exist are skipped. Run `sync` as often as you like.                     |

## What is deliberately not here

- **Editing, adding, custom study, browsing** -- Anki does these better on a
  screen with a keyboard.
- **Audio** -- the device has no speaker.
- **A second level of undo** -- the state before the previous review is not
  kept.
