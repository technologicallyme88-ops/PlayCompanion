# Chess: the screen graph

Every screen, every input, every destination. Written down because the flow was
built by bolting screens onto each other and three separate defects came from
edges nobody had drawn. If you change navigation in `ChessActivity`, change this
first and make the code match it.

Chess does not know that `Games` is its parent. It calls `shelf::leave()` and
the shelf decides; the edge is drawn here because that is where you end up, not
because chess names it. See [shelf.md](shelf.md).

    BoardMatch --> Menu: Back (tells them, stops, restores solo game)
    BoardMatch --> SetBoard: gear
    BoardMatch --> Rematch: game ends
    BoardMatch --> Rematch: they leave or go silent
    BoardMatch --> Rematch: they ask for a new game
    BoardMatch --> Away: sleep (does NOT save)

    Rematch --> Menu: Back / BACK (tells them, stops)
    Rematch --> Rematch: PLAY AGAIN (waits for their answer)
    Rematch --> BoardMatch: both said yes

## The rules the graph encodes

**Multiplayer is an action, not a setting.** Nothing about `PLAY NEARBY`
persists. Re-entering chess always starts at MENU with the radio off.

**Settings has two doors and they are not the same screen.** The door decides
the row set and the close label, not just the exit. `NEW GAME` and `TAKE BACK`
act on a board you are looking at, so they only exist behind the gear.

**Three things must never happen during a match**, and each was a real defect
found separately:

- Saving. The position on screen is the shared game, and writing it over the
  single-player save loses the game you were keeping. Blocked in `Back`,
  in `onExit` (sleep and app-switch), and nowhere else writes.
- Resetting on your own. You cannot restart a shared board without telling the
  other device. Every path that would (`NEW GAME` in settings, the board's
  `PLAY AGAIN` capsule, a pending restart on close) asks instead.
- Leaving silently. Every exit sends a note first, so the other device says
  `LEFT` rather than sitting on `DECIDING` until the silence timeout notices.

**The zone under the seats belongs to the game.** `buildLink()` returns it and
chess draws the position it has just finished there, which is what turned that
space from slack into the thing worth looking at while you decide. The link
layer cannot draw it -- a board is chess's material, not the link's -- so it
hands over a slot and stays out, the same split the board screen uses.

**One door into the MENU.** `goToMenu()` is the only way in, so the `CONTINUE`
row cannot describe a position from two games ago -- which it did, when three
routes each kept their own copy of the bookkeeping.

**`update()` runs before every early return in `loop()`.** The settings overlay
returns from that function, so a match that only ticked when no overlay was open
would die whenever somebody opened one for ten seconds.
