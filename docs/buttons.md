# The buttons

What the physical buttons are for in our apps. The answer turned out to be
almost entirely a hardware question, and once the hardware is right the design
question mostly disappears.

---

## 1. The X4 Pro has two buttons

Not six. Our own board profile says so, and it is confirmed on hardware:

```cpp
// {back, confirm, left, right, up, down, power, powerActiveHigh}
{PIN_UNASSIGNED, PIN_UNASSIGNED, PIN_UNASSIGNED, PIN_UNASSIGNED, 0, 7, 3, false},
```

`freeink-sdk/.../BoardConfig.h`, `XTEINK_X4_PRO`

- **Two side keys.** Physically left is GPIO0, physically right is GPIO7. They
  are wired to logical **Up** and **Down**, and the comment beside them says
  what they are for: _"The two keys map to the reader's page pair (Up=prev /
  Down=next)."_ On the device they are moulded page-turn keys.
- **Power**, GPIO3.
- **No Back. No Confirm. No Left. No Right.** All four are `PIN_UNASSIGNED`,
  which `InputManager::begin` skips entirely (`if (pin >= 0)`), so they are
  never even configured as inputs. They cannot fire. They do not exist.

The X4 Pro dropped the front button row the older C3 X4 had. The
`frontButtonBack` / `frontButtonConfirm` settings still exist and still remap,
they just remap indices onto pins that are not connected to anything.

**So the entire button budget available to a game on this device is two keys
that the case labels as previous and next page.**

## 2. Back is a swipe, and it already works

Worth stating plainly, because the pin map above looks alarming and it is not.
`MappedInputManager::wasReleased` opens with:

```cpp
if (button == Button::Back && wasBackGesture()) return true;
```

and `wasBackGesture()` is a left-to-right swipe anchored near the left edge. So
every `mappedInput.wasReleased(Button::Back)` in `apps_local` -- all seventeen
apps -- resolves through the gesture on this device, and every game is
exitable. The physical half of that call has been dead since the X4 Pro was
targeted and nothing depended on it.

## 3. What we actually use

Counted across `src/apps_local/`:

| Button       | Apps that read it | Exists on X4 Pro |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Back         | 17                | as a swipe       |
| Confirm      | 3                 | **no**           |
| Left / Right | 1                 | **no**           |
| Up / Down    | 3                 | **yes**          |

Thirteen of seventeen apps use Back and nothing else. **The two buttons the
device actually has are unused by every game we have built.** The only apps that
touch them are the reader-shaped ones: hackernews, xkcd, and chess.

That is the whole finding. Not "we should use the buttons more" as a matter of
taste -- the device ships with two physical keys, they are page keys, and our
games ignore them.

## 4. The rule

**A button may only do something that has no "where".** Every action is one of:

- **Pointing** -- which cell, column, card, category. The answer is a position,
  the finger names it exactly, and a button can only express it by inventing a
  cursor. design-language.md removed cursors from Chess and Connections for
  cause and that stays removed.
- **Stepping** -- next page, previous page. No position at all. Drawing a
  control for these is drawing a place for something that does not live
  anywhere, which is why the shelf's page marks felt wrong as buttons.

On this hardware the rule is almost self-executing, because the only two buttons
are page keys. **Up and Down page. Nothing else is a button, because nothing
else is a button.**

**And paging by button is never the only route.** The page marks stay tappable.
Not because touch is better, but because the moment a button is the only way to
reach something we have two input models again, and the invisible one wins
arguments it should not.

## 5. The affordance is moulded into the case

This is where the iPhone comparison lands, and the answer is that we do not need
one.

The iPhone shows a transient indicator at the edge, aligned to the key, that
fades. E-ink cannot fade, and a refresh is a visible blink, so an appear/dismiss
indicator costs two full repaints to tell you about something you just did.

We do not need it because **the buttons are already labelled -- by the
hardware.** They are physical page-turn keys on a device whose primary app is a
reader that uses them to turn pages. A user who has read one book on this device
has already learned them. Making them page the shelf and the HOW TO PLAY pages
is _consistency with the thing they already do_, not a new capability that needs
teaching.

An on-screen tick would be permanent ink -- on every screen, forever -- to teach
something the case already teaches. That fails the ink-budget rule (black is
inversely proportional to how often it changes) for no gain.

**So: no affordance. Just make the page keys page.** If the buttons ever gain a
job the case does not imply, that decision comes back.

---

## 6. What this changes

1. **Up/Down page wherever there are pages**: the shelf folder, and HOW TO PLAY
   in every game. Behaviour only; nothing is drawn or removed.
2. **design-language.md is wrong and gets corrected.** It says "Keep the
   physical buttons for Back and system functions", and on this device there is
   no physical Back button. The corrected rule is the one in section 4.
3. **The `mapLabels(...)` calls stay, and are documented as inert here.** All
   fifteen feed `drawButtonHints`, which returns immediately when
   `gpio.hasTouch()`. They are not dead code in the fork's other targets -- the
   C3 X4 and X3 have the front row and do draw hints -- but on the X4 Pro they
   have never drawn anything, and twelve of them pass `("Back", "", "", "")`,
   which would label a button that is not there.

Nothing here needs the device in hand. The pin map is committed, the gesture
path is testable in the simulator, and paging is verifiable with a screenshot.
