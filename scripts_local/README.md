# Workspace scripts

The live copies. `../../scripts/*.sh` at the workspace root are symlinks to
these, so `./scripts/dev.sh` and `firmware-next/scripts_local/dev.sh` both work.

They live here because the workspace root is not a git repository and this
directory is; keeping them outside meant the whole development loop was one `rm`
from gone.

| Script             | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wt.sh`            | One worktree per piece of work in flight. `new <name>` makes one (own branch, own build output, own SD card, own screenshots); `list` shows what exists and what state; `drop <name>` removes it, refusing while work is unmerged.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `check.sh`         | Everything verifiable without a device: every host suite, then both builds. Run before every commit. `--tests` for suites only. `--committed` verifies HEAD in a throwaway worktree instead of your working tree. Reports each suite's own exit code, not just its last line. On the deploy branch it also fails when `site/emulator/` is older than the sources it was built from; `host-tests/checksh/` is that gate's own test.            |
| `dev.sh`           | Mario's simulator. Watches the sources, rebuilds and restarts on change, reopens a closed window. Leave it running. Takes a worktree name (`dev.sh battleship`) to watch just that work; no argument watches the integration tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `sim-shot.sh`      | Scripted headless run for agents: drives taps and keys, captures screenshots, prints the activity trace. Set `SIM_LOG_GREP` to widen it (`SIM_LOG_GREP=.` for everything); the default hides `LOG_INF`/`LOG_DBG`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `mutate.sh`        | One mutation test, honestly. Distinguishes CAUGHT from SURVIVED from BUILD-FAIL from NO-MATCH, because the last two look exactly like the first two and were read as results three times in one session. Always restores the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `sim-link.sh`      | Two simulators at once, for local multiplayer. No args gives two interactive windows; with args, headless with `-a`/`-b` screenshot suffixes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `sim.sh`           | One-shot interactive launch. Prefer `dev.sh`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `sync.sh`          | Reports how far behind CrossPoint's `develop` we are, computes (never lists) the files both sides changed to warn where the merge will conflict, and watches upstream's X4 Pro branch, whose landing is a sit-down merge (see LOCAL_SCOPE.md). `--apply` merges and verifies in a throwaway worktree at the committed tip, then lands as a fast-forward. Works with a dirty tree unless upstream touched a file you have uncommitted work in. |
| `sim_catchup.py`   | Not run by hand. A `pre:` build hook that patches the fetched simulator library where it lags this branch. Prints when a patch stops applying, which is how we learn CrossPoint has fixed it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `stack-budget.sh`  | Proves every FreeRTOS task's deepest call path fits the stack it was given, from the `.su`/`.ci` files the firmware compiler emits. `--verbose` prints the deepest path. `stack_budget.py` is the implementation; CI's "Stack fits its task" step calls it directly.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `shoot-board.sh`   | Regenerates the Toy Battle board shot the site card uses. Every site image was once captured by hand and its recipe lost; these two keep theirs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `shoot-shell.sh`   | Photographs the shell end to end: menu, setup, map list, rules pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `lib-sim.sh`       | Not run directly. Shared setup sourced by `dev.sh`, `sim.sh`, `sim-shot.sh` and `sim-link.sh`; derives every path from the tree it lives in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `sim_host_libs.py` | Not run by hand. Links the host libraries the simulator's own headers assume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## One tree per piece of work

Several apps get built at once, so several trees exist at once: `firmware-next/`
integrates, and each `wt/<name>/` is one effort's own worktree. Every path these
scripts use is derived from the tree they were invoked in -- build output, build
lock, build log, SD card, `qa-artifacts/` -- so two trees never collide.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Inside a `wt/` tree, use `./scripts_local/`, not the workspace-root
  `./scripts/`.** Those symlinks resolve back to `firmware-next` from anywhere,
  so the root copy would build and photograph the integration tree while you
  believed you were testing your own. It boots fine and every tap lands
  somewhere else, which is indistinguishable from the feature being broken. The
  scripts refuse rather than let that happen quietly.
- **The PlatformIO object cache is shared** at `../.pio-cache` via
  `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_CACHE_DIR`. It is 7.6GB and content-addressed, so a brand
  new worktree's first build is mostly cache hits instead of a cold compile.

### What "integration" actually means

`firmware-next/` is for the merge and what the merge forces, and nothing else:

- `git merge app/<name>` and resolving its conflicts;
- rebuilding `site/emulator/` from the merged tree, because both sides' binaries
  conflict and neither of them is right;
- the version bump and the release tag.

Everything else is work and wants its own tree, **including the things that feel
like plumbing**: a new script, a new `check.sh` stage, a build fix, a rewritten
doc. If you are AUTHORING rather than reconciling, you are in the wrong tree.

This needs saying because "it is only integration" is an easy thing to tell
yourself. On 2026-08-14 it produced eight direct commits on `xteink` -- a
screenshot recipe, a `check.sh` stage, two build fixes -- none of which were the
merge or forced by it.

**Two sessions in this tree at once is the normal case, not the exception.**
Before touching it:

```bash
git status --short --ignore-submodules=untracked  # dirty means someone is mid-merge
git log --first-parent origin/xteink..HEAD        # unpushed means the same
```

(`--ignore-submodules=untracked` because the icon tools drop a `__pycache__/`
inside `freeink-sdk`, which otherwise reads as permanent dirt.)

Either one means leave it alone. The cost is not hypothetical: that same day two
windows independently diagnosed the same simulator build failure, because both
were working in the shared tree and neither could see the other coming.

Each simulator instance gets its own SD card via `CROSSPOINT_SIM_SD`: each
tree's own `fs_agent/` for scripted runs, and `../fs_mario/` at the workspace
root for Mario's, which sits outside every tree so his saves and settings follow
him whichever one `dev.sh` is watching. All are gitignored, as is
`qa-artifacts/` where screenshots land.
