"""Bring the CrossPoint simulator up to this branch.

The simulator library (crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-simulator) tracks
CrossPoint's `develop`. This fork sits on `feat-touch-ui`, which is ahead of it,
and two things main.cpp uses are missing from the simulator's stubs:

  * BoardConfig::BoardProfile has no `input` member
  * Arduino.h does not declare digitalRead / digitalWrite

Header stubs in sim-stubs/ cannot fix these: a library's own include path wins
over the project's -I, so its BoardConfig.h and Arduino.h always shadow ours.
Patching the fetched copy is the only thing that works, so this runs as a `pre:`
hook on every simulator build.

Deliberately NOT sent upstream as a PR. Mario wants to see how CrossPoint solves
the same problem and compare, and a merged PR would make their answer ours.

Every edit is idempotent, and anything unexpected is reported rather than
swallowed -- when the simulator catches up, this should start saying so.
