# One worktree per piece of work in flight.

#   ./scripts/wt.sh new <name> [--from <branch>]   # make one
#   ./scripts/wt.sh list                           # what exists, and what state

# Why this exists: everything used to happen in firmware-next/. Several apps
# were built at once, so that one tree held four efforts' uncommitted work at
# the same time, nothing could be committed atomically, agent screenshot runs
# shared one SD card and one qa-artifacts/ directory, every save restarted
# Mario's simulator, and check.sh reported green for the *union* of everyone's
# code. That last one is not theoretical: Dungeon, Insider and Hacker News all
# shipped against Toybox symbols that were never committed, and xteink HEAD did
# not compile for three commits, because every check ran against a dirty tree.
#
# A worktree per effort fixes all of it at once: own branch, own build output,
# own SD card, own screenshots, own build lock.

Use scripts_local/ from inside the tree, NOT the workspace-root scripts/ --
those resolve to firmware-next and would test the wrong code. The scripts
refuse rather than let that happen quietly.
