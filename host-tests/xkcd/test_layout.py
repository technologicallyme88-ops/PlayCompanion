"""The layout rule: which way round a comic goes, and how big.

**This is the logic that has broken most often in this app, and it had no tests
until it had broken four times.** Every one of those was found by hand, by
replaying the rule over the real archive and noticing the answer disagreed with
the model that chose the constants. That is not a process that survives being
forgotten, so the properties are written down here instead.

Tests the shipping functions in tools_local/xkcd/build_pack.py directly rather
than a port of them: a second implementation of a rule this fiddly would drift,
which is the same reason the pack and the device share one ditherer.
