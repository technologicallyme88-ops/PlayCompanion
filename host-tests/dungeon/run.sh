# The screens are linked in too, for one test: the adventurer's guide teaches
# on the tutorial's own board, and the pages that make up that lesson live with
# the drawing code. FreeInkUI is freestanding C++17, so this costs one more

# Two GCC-only suppressions. Neither shows up under Apple clang, which is why
# they only appeared once CI built this on Linux.

# -Wno-comment: FreeInkUIIcon.h documents a shell command in a // comment whose
# line ends in a backslash, which GCC reads as a line continuation. The header
# belongs to the pinned freeink-sdk submodule, so silencing it here is cheaper
# than carrying a patch against someone else's tree.
#
# -Wno-format-truncation: the screen buffers are sized for what fits on a
# 480x800 panel, not for INT_MIN, and snprintf truncating is the intended
# behaviour rather than a bug to prevent. GCC assumes every int spans its full
# range and cannot see that a page counter is bounded by a constant.
