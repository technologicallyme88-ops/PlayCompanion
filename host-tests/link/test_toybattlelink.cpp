// A real game of Toy Battle between two devices over a hostile link.
//
// Three things about this game stress the layer, and all three are asserted
// here rather than argued about:
//
//   * The opening is dealt, not fixed. `Game` carries the seed, the terrain and
//     whether special bases are on, so the leader deals and everything two
//     devices must agree on rides along in the first state packet. The follower
//     must NOT deal: a randomised opening would be a different game on each
//     device, and a zeroed one has no legal move at all.
//   * A zeroed `Game` reads as finished. `matchGameOver()` is polled every pass
//     and latches the rematch screen the moment it is true, permanently -- so a
//     follower that has not been dealt to yet must not answer yes.
//     testAFollowerThatHasNotBeenDealtToIsNotFinished pins it.
//   * A turn can be several placements. Cap'n places a second troop, and the
//     whole chain is one `Move` applied to one state, so the wire never sees a
//     half-finished turn.
