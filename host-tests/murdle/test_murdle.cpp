// Murdle puzzle tests. Freestanding: no device, no PlatformIO.
//
// A generator is the wrong shape for spot tests. Almost any bug in one produces
// puzzles that look completely normal and are quietly unsolvable, or quietly
// have two answers, or quietly need a guess -- and you find out when somebody
// spends twenty minutes on one. So the suite here is the equivalent of perft:
// every tier, thousands of sequential seeds, and five properties asserted on
// every single case.
//
//   1. it has exactly one solution
//   2. every clue in it is true of that solution
//   3. no clue can be removed and leave it unique  (it is minimal)
//   4. the reference solver reaches the answer with pencil rules alone
//      (it is fair: no case ever needs a guess)
//   5. the same seed builds the same case twice   (saves are six bytes)
//
// Properties 3 and 4 are the ones worth the runtime. Uniqueness is easy and
// almost meaningless on its own: a unique puzzle can still be unsolvable
// without trial and error, and a puzzle carrying four redundant clues is
// unique, solvable, and boring.
