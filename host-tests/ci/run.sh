# The "Host tests" step in .github/workflows/crossplay-ci.yml forgives nothing:
# every suite must exit zero. It used to forgive exactly one thing --
# ui:paperOnTheBand, a real baseline failure until 2026-08-10 -- and the
# exemption outlived the failure by four days. In that window a regression in
# exactly that test passed CI with a warning while a local check.sh went red.
#
# Shell in a yaml file is the one part of this repo nothing else executes, so
# it is the one part that can quietly stop meaning what it says. This runs the
# step's actual text -- extracted from the yaml, not copied -- against the
# shapes that once got special treatment, and asserts none of them do now.
