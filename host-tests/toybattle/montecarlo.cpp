// Does playing the game out beat evaluating it?
//
// Mario's call, 2026-08-11, after beating GENERAL three in a row: hand-tuned
// heuristics are the wrong shape for this, and the mechanical answer is to
// compute a great many scenarios and look at the outcomes. That is Monte Carlo,
// and this measures whether the simplest possible version of it -- FLAT, no
// tree, no tuning -- already beats the heuristic brain.
//
// Why it fits this game better than the evaluation does:
//
//   * There is nothing to tune. The value of a position is how often you win
//     from it, which is measured rather than asserted. Four evaluation terms
//     have been tried here and all four were deleted.
//   * NINE BOARDS WITH DIFFERENT SPECIALS. A heuristic needs a human to decide
//     what a Nullify base is worth against a gated pier. A rollout never asks:
//     it plays the real rules on the real board, so each board's character
//     falls out of the win counts for free. This is the argument that matters,
//     and it was Mario's.
//
// It does NOT cheat. Rollouts start from `observe(g, seat)` -- the same
// reconstructed view chooseMove gets, where the enemy rack is inferred from
// what has been seen rather than read off the real state. That is
// determinization, and using the true state instead would measure a player we
// could never ship.
