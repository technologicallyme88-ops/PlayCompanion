// Self-play data for FITTING the evaluation instead of guessing it.
//
// Mario, 2026-08-11, after beating GENERAL three games running and asking why
// chess engines learn without human games: the mechanical answer is to play a
// great many games and let the outcomes decide. AlphaZero is the extreme of
// that; this is the version that fits on an ESP32, and it is standard practice
// in chess engines -- play, record every position with how its game ended, and
// solve for the weights that best predict the result.
//
// Why this and not a deeper search: `evaluate` is seven numbers -- 400 a medal,
// 25 a base, 8 a reachable slot, 6 a rack troop -- and I chose all of them by
// eye. Nothing has ever fitted them. The tournament could only ever RANK
// variants that shared them, so it could rank depth and was structurally
// unable to say the goal was wrong.
//
// Nothing here runs on the device. The output is a table of integers; the
// firmware keeps the same search and the same cost.
//
// Emits one line per position: label then features, from the MOVER's view.

//
// He is right, and the first feature set could not do that by construction. A
// flat `hq_pressure` weight says threatening the H.Q. is worth three and a
// half medals ALWAYS -- whether the brain is one placement from winning the
// medal race or nine. A linear evaluation cannot express "it depends" unless
// the FEATURES carry the situation, so these do: how far each side is from
// each of the two ways to win. Then closeness is what gets weighed, and the
// two routes are compared on one scale instead of one being a constant.
