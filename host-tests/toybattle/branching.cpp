// How wide does this game actually get?
//
// `kMaxCandidates` is 384, and the comment sizing it records a measured worst of
// 363 over 400 games. That measurement was taken when the only boards were
// Castle Field and PROVING GROUND. There are nine real boards now, two of them
// shapes nothing was tuned on: Station Metal-X is a web with two hubs of degree
// seven, and La Croisette is the only real board carrying four special kinds at
// once, each of which offers a use-it-or-decline choice that multiplies moves.
//
// Overflow here does not crash. `candidates()` fills to `max` and stops, so the
// brain silently searches a subset and plays on. A suite of millions of
// assertions stays green while the opponent quietly gets worse on exactly the
// boards Mario just added. That is why this is measured against a buffer far
// larger than the shipped one rather than asserted against the shipped one.
//
// Not part of check.sh: it is a measurement, like tournament.sh.
