// The shelf: everything this fork adds to the device, and the only way in or
// out of it.
//
// Home gets one GAMES row. It opens a folder holding the retained games.
// That is the whole hierarchy.
//
//   Home
//     Browse Files / Recent Books / File Transfer / Settings   (upstream's)
//     GAMES >   chess, battleship, connections, solitaire
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Three rules, and the reason each exists.
//
// 1. A folder holds apps, never another folder. Depth is capped at two by the
//    type, not by discipline: there is nowhere in `Folder` to put a folder.
//    Two taps reaches anything, forever, and on a panel that repaints in half a
//    second a third tap is a real cost.
//
// 2. Games and apps are the same kind of row. The only difference between
//    chess and a spaced-repetition deck is which folder it sits in, so there is
//    one `Item` type and one launcher. The previous fork had two near-identical
//    entry structs for no reason anyone could name.
//
// 3. An app never knows where it came from. It calls leave() and lands in its
//    folder; a folder calls leave() and lands on Home. This is the one exit and
//    every app uses it.
//
// Rule 3 is why this file was written before any app moved. The fork this
// replaces carried a `setReturnHere()` / `takeReturnHere()` breadcrumb that had
// to be *redeemed by a different activity on entry*, so a missed redemption
// stranded you in the wrong menu -- and it existed only because upstream's own
// games each hardcoded `goToApps()` and could not be edited. Every app here is
// ours. None of them should ever name a destination.
