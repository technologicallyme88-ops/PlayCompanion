// Minesweeper, the rules. Freestanding: no renderer, no Activity, no storage.
//
// Eight by ten with ten mines, which is 12.5% density -- between the classic
// beginner board's 12.3% and its intermediate 15.6%. The shape is set by the
// panel rather than by tradition: the full 480px over eight columns is a 60px
// cell drawn edge to edge, which is a thumb and a half, and ten rows is what
// fits under the header with the counter strip still on screen.
//
// Two properties are built in rather than checked for, which is this project's
// rule about promised properties:
//
//   * **The first tap is always safe.** Mines are laid AFTER it, excluding that
//     cell and its neighbours, so the opening is always a flood rather than a
//     coin toss. Re-rolling until the first tap missed would be the same result
//     bolted on, and would loop forever on a dense board.
//   * **A revealed zero opens its neighbours.** The flood is the game; a version
//     that made the player tap every empty cell would be a chore with the same
//     rules.

// to a covered one, which cannot happen in this game, and the tests missed it
