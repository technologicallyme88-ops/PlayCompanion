// D&Diagrams: the board, and nothing that needs hardware.
//
// No Arduino, no renderer, no heap -- so host-tests/dungeon/ can run the whole
// thing on a laptop. See docs/building-apps.md; every app in this fork is split
// this way and it is the only reason the rules get real coverage.
//
// The rules the player is solving for, for reference, because nothing in this
// file states them:
//
//   1. The number beside a row or column is how many walls it holds.
//   2. Every dead end holds a monster, and every monster is in a dead end.
//   3. Every chest sits in a 3x3 room of floor with exactly one way in.
//   4. Corridors are one cell wide: no 2x2 of floor outside a treasure room.
//   5. All floor is connected.
//
// They are absent here on purpose. Each puzzle in the bank was proved to have
// exactly one solution by tools_local/dungeon/gen_dungeons.py, which carries the rules,
// so a finished board is checked against that solution with one comparison.
// Implementing the rules a second time would mean two implementations that have
// to agree forever, and the device would get nothing for it -- the puzzle is
// solved when the walls are right, and only one arrangement of walls is.
