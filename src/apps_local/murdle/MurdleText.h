// Turning a clue into a sentence.
//
// This is the only place in the game that knows any English, and it is separate
// from MurdleCore for a reason: the logic must never depend on how something is
// worded, and the wording must never be able to change what a clue means. A
// clue is a mask; a sentence is a rendering of that mask; the solver reads the
// mask and the player reads the sentence, and the test asserts they agree.
//
// Freestanding, so host-tests/murdle/ can build every sentence this can produce
// out of the whole cast table and check that each one comes out as correct
// English rather than as a mad lib.
