// The state machine, in full, because getting it wrong is what makes a game
// feel arbitrary. Six views; Back is uniform and has no exceptions -- from Menu
// it leaves the app, from anywhere else it goes to its parent.

//
// Three things about it are deliberate and are the parts that would otherwise
// be rediscovered as bugs.
//
// CLUES AND GRID ARE NOT TWO VIEWS. They are two faces of one Case state. If
// the toggle were navigation then Back would sometimes mean "the other face"
// and sometimes mean "leave", which stays invisible until somebody loses their
// marks.
//
// EVERY NEW CASE GOES THROUGH ONE FUNNEL. requestNewCase() is the only thing
// that generates, and it is what asks before dropping an open case. A door
// added later cannot get this wrong because there is no choice left at the call
// site. Chess learned this the expensive way: the same defect kept arriving
// through new doors until the intent had one home.
//
// DIFFICULTY NEVER TOUCHES AN OPEN CASE. The setting is read once, at
// generation, and a saved case carries its own shape, so changing the tier
// mid-case is harmless and a restored case comes back the size it was made at.
