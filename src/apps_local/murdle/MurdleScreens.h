// The Murdle screens, as freestanding builders over plain models.
//
// Everything shaped like chrome goes through toybox::Screen and inherits the
// theme. What is hand-drawn is the game's own surface, and that is exactly two
// things: the deduction grid and the clue list. See ../ui/ToyboxScreen.h for
// why these take a Screen and touch no renderer.
//
// THE ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT THE GRID. At four categories of four it is 12x12,
// which is 144 tappable cells against an interaction buffer that holds 24. So
// the grid does not register cells at all: it registers itself, and gives back
// the GridLayout it drew with so the activity can turn a tap into a cell using
// the same arithmetic that placed the pixels. That is the fork's hit-testing
// rule (never compute a tappable region a second time) applied to a surface too
// dense to express as components -- not an exception to it.
