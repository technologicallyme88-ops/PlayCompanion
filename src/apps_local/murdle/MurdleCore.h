// Murdle: the puzzle, with nothing else in it.
//
// Freestanding C++17 -- no renderer, no storage, no clock, no Arduino -- so
// host-tests/murdle/ can generate tens of thousands of cases on a laptop and
// assert that every single one of them is a fair puzzle. See docs/apps/murdle.md for
// the design and docs/shelf.md for the three-way split.
//
// THE GAME. Every suspect has a weapon and a location, and at the top tiers a
// motive. Those assignments are a bijection: one suspect per location, one
// weapon per suspect, nobody shares. Exactly one of the suspects is the
// murderer. You solve the whole assignment from a list of clues, and one
// further clue names the crime scene, which is what pins the murderer.
//
// THE ONE PREDICATE. The book's tutorial uses five clues that read like five
// different kinds of sentence ("whoever was in the stadium was right-handed",
// "the suspect with the pencil resented the person at Old Main", "the body was
// found next to peeling paint"). Logically they are all the same thing:
//
//     the row selected by ANCHOR has, in category `targetCat`,
//     a value drawn from `targetMask`.
//
// A direct positive is a mask with one bit set. A negative is one bit clear. An
// attribute clue is the set of suspects carrying that attribute. An either/or
// is two bits. The murder clue is the same predicate with the row selected by
// "whichever row the murderer is in" instead of by a named item.
//
// That collapse is the whole reason this file is short. One predicate means one
// solver, one verifier, one save format, and all the variety lives in the
// sentences (MurdleText) rather than in the logic.

//
// This is the fourth attempt at the marking logic and the first that is not a
// bookkeeping problem. The first three stored two different kinds of thing in
// the same cells -- what the player entered, and the crosses that follow from
// it -- and then tried to keep them in step. Every defect was a failure of that
// step, and there were four of them: a cleared Yes leaving its crosses behind,
// an overruled Yes leaving its crosses behind, a cross justified by two Yeses
// vanishing when one went, and clearing a Yes taking away crosses a different
// Yes still needed. Two were found by Mario playing, one by printing the grid,
// one by a fuzz test. None by the code being read.
//
// They were all the same bug wearing different clothes, so the fix is not
// another case: a consequence is not a fact to be maintained, it is a question
// to be answered. `shown()` answers it from the assertions each time it is
// asked. There is no second copy, so there is nothing to fall out of step, and
// undo is free -- take away the assertion and its consequences are simply no
// longer derivable. That is also why the commercial logic-grid apps need a
// multi-level undo stack and this does not.
//
