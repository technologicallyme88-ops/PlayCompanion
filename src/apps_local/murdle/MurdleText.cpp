// Who the clue is about

// ONLY THE BODY CLUE NAMES A THING BY ITS DETAIL. Every clue here says "the
// hammer", never "the thing with the split handle".
//
// This was the other way round for four rounds, and round five made it worse by
// extending trait-naming from weapons to places as well, on the theory that an
// extra lookup is most of the difference between an easy tier and a hard one.
// Four play-testers demolished that in the same breath, independently:
//
//   "a seven-word detour to avoid saying 'the wire'"
//   "a pointer dereference"
//   "clue 6 is just cosplaying clue 13"
//
// They are right, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of taste.
// The case file has to print every weapon and place with its detail attached --
// it cannot print only the crime scene's, or the body clue would give itself
// away -- so the mapping from detail to name is sitting on the page. Naming by
// detail can therefore only ever be a synonym, and a longer one. It buys no
// difficulty, costs a line of a small screen, and does real harm: one case
// called the same place "the garden" in one clue and "the place with trampled
// flowers" two clues later, and a reader who misses that they are the same
// thing is stuck on a puzzle that is not actually hard.
//
// The body clue keeps the device because there it IS the conceit -- the game's
// last step is recognising a scene from a detail, and it has nowhere else to
// hide the murderer.
//
// THE REGISTER IS FIXED PER CATEGORY, NOT PER CASE, AND THAT IS THE THIRD
// ATTEMPT AT IT.
//
// First it varied per clue, and a play-tester got "Whoever carried the fork"
// beside "The one with the oar" in one case and said it read like several
// people wrote it. So it became one coin flip per case -- which is how a later
// tester ended up counting TEN OF TWELVE CLUES opening with the literal words
// "The one". Consistency bought at the price of a metronome.
//
// Both complaints are about the same thing from opposite ends: the variation
// was arbitrary. Keying it to the anchor's category makes it systematic
// instead. A weapon anchor always reads "the suspect with", a place anchor
// always "the one", a motive anchor always "the suspect driven by" -- so a case
// mixes phrasings without ever contradicting itself, and the same clue shape
// always sounds the same way. Nothing is random, so nothing can look sloppy.
