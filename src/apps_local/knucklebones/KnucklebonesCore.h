// Knucklebones, the rules. Freestanding: no renderer, no Activity, no storage.
//
// Two players, a three by three grid each, and one die. On your turn you roll,
// then drop the die into one of your three columns. Placing a value into a
// column destroys every copy of that value in the *opponent's* matching column.
// A column scores each value as v * n * n, where n is how many copies of v it
// holds -- so three fours are 36 rather than 12, and that multiplier is the
// whole game. It ends the moment either grid fills; the higher total wins.
//
// The shape follows Jaipur's, for the same reasons:
//
//   * `Game` is the whole shared state AND the wire format, so two devices
//     cannot drift. It is a POD with no pointers and no padding worth hiding.
//   * Everything derivable is derived: scores, whether a column has room, who
//     is winning, whether it is over. A stored total that disagrees with the
//     grid is a bug class that does not exist here.
//   * The die is part of the state, not a return value. Both devices have to
//     agree on what was rolled before it is placed, and a roll that lived only
//     in a local would have to be sent separately and could go missing.
