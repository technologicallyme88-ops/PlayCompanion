// Knucklebones on the device. The thin layer: the renderer, input and the
// shelf. Everything it knows about the game itself lives in the three
// freestanding headers beside it, which is what lets those be tested without a
// panel.
//
// It derives from LinkActivity rather than Activity, so the two-device path is
// the same code as the solo one plus a different opponent. The game never sees
// a radio, an address or a packet: it sees a match with a turn.
//
// It owns four things and no fifth: which screen is showing, the game, the
// how-to page, and which seat this device plays. Every other question -- where
// Back goes, whose turn it is, whether a tap is allowed -- is answered by
// KnucklebonesFlow.h, so there is nowhere here for a second opinion to form.
