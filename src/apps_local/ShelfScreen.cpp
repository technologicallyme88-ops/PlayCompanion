  // **This is a position indicator that happens to be tappable, not a row of
  // buttons**, and the difference is the whole design. The first version tiled
  // the full width with page-sized targets, and it read as a control -- which
  // was wrong twice over. The device already has the control: the side buttons
  // step the cursor and the page follows, so drawing a second one is
  // reinventing hardware we already have. And what was actually missing was
  // never a control at all, it was the *signal* that more games exist.
  //
  // It stays tappable rather than becoming pure decoration because of a fact
  // about this hardware: `BaseTheme::drawButtonHints` returns immediately when
  // `gpio.hasTouch()`, and the X4 Pro has a GT911. So upstream deliberately
  // teaches nothing about the physical buttons on a touch device, which means a
  // touch user has no way to discover that Up and Down would page. Touch has to
  // stay complete. The iOS home screen resolves the same tension the same way:
  // dots that read as position and happen to accept a tap.
  //
  // So the marks are a small centred cluster with air around them rather than a
