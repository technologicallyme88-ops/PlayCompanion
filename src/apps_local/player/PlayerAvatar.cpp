// One row per word, in the same order as the word lists in PlayerName.cpp.
//
// PART takes ONE token and spells both halves from it: the word, and the two
// bitmaps that draw it. That is deliberate and it was earned. Written as two
// hand-kept columns -- {"SPIKY", &icon_hair_spiky_48, ...} -- a row can name one
// word and point at another's drawing, and there is no build error, no visible
// defect, and no test that can see it: a deliberate swap of two hair pointers
// survived a check written specifically to catch it, because the check compared
// the word column against the vocabulary and the word column was still right.
//
// With one token there is no second column to be wrong. Reordering rows still
// breaks the pairing against PlayerName.cpp's list, and the test below catches
// that, because the word moves with its artwork. The only remaining way to
// mismatch is to lie in the manifest (`hair_SPIKY = hair_curly`), which is a
// data error in the asset pipeline rather than something C++ can prevent.
//
// This is why tools_local/avatar/avatar.txt shouts its aliases.
