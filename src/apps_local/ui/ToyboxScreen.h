// Toybox screens, the way the SDK intends them to be written.
//
// A screen is a free function taking a `toybox::Screen&` and a plain model
// struct. It touches no renderer, no Activity and no storage, which buys two
// things:
//
//   * `freeink::ui::Screen` substitutes theme tokens into every component it
//     builds (title style, side padding, row height, row gap, selection style).
//     Calling the components directly opts out of that, and the first two bugs
//     in this fork's adoption of FreeInkUI were exactly the tokens `Screen`
//     would have supplied: a header that defaulted to 6px of padding, and a
//     title drawn black on a black band.
//   * screens become host-testable. FreeInkUI is freestanding C++17, so a test
//     builds one against a fake draw target and asserts on what it drew and on
//     what it registered as tappable. See host-tests/ui/.
//
// That second point is why this header includes only the SDK and the tokens.
// Anything renderer-shaped belongs in ToyboxTheme.h, which screens must not
// include; host-tests/ui/run.sh compiles the builders with nothing else on the
// include path, so a stray dependency fails the build rather than quietly
// costing the tests.
//
// Activities keep what genuinely needs hardware: reading state, filling in the
// model, and drawing their own play surface into the body rect.

// bytes; compiled for wasm32 the next call reused it and Screen::contentRect()
// came back (60,21 0x0), so games drew their whole board off the top of the
// panel. The SDK knows the hazard -- FreeInkUIGfxRenderer.h's GfxRendererFrame
// keeps a DeviceContext member for exactly this reason -- but nothing stops a
// caller from getting it wrong.

// in a base of the wrapper gives the SDK object something that outlives it. The

// item painted its icon a row below the band -- in black, on top of the black
// player footer. Every caller now has to say where its list is scrolled to, and
