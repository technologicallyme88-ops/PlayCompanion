// Solitaire's screens, as freestanding builders. See ToyboxScreen.h for why
// screens are written this way: a free function over a plain model, drawing
// into a DrawTarget it was handed, so host-tests/ui/ can run them with a fake
// target and no device.
//
// This is the first landscape app in the fork. The renderer does the rotation
// (`setOrientation(LandscapeCounterClockwise)` swaps logical width and height)
// and `tapToLogical()` already maps touches through the same transform, so
// everything below is plain 800x480 arithmetic with no rotation in it.
