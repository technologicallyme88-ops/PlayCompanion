// A device-shaped heap for the simulator.
//
// The simulator's ESPMock answers 1024*1024 to every heap question, forever.
// Three things follow, and all of them hid real behaviour:
//
//   * the number is wrong. An X4 Pro reports 327680 total and around 275000
//     free, so the simulator claims roughly three times the room there is.
//   * the number never moves, so a leak, or a screen that allocates more each
//     time it opens, looks identical to one that does not.
//   * two guards in this firmware are written as `if (getMaxAllocHeap() < n)`
//     and therefore have never once been taken outside a device:
//     DictZip.cpp:187 and Dictionary.cpp:326.
//
// This counts what the firmware actually allocates and answers from the
// device's budget instead. It is a model, not an emulator: it tracks the
// program's own C++ allocations, so the numbers move with the firmware's
// behaviour rather than matching an ESP32's allocator byte for byte. That is
// the part worth having, because the questions being asked of it are "is this
// growing" and "is there room for one more buffer".
//
// Not compiled into firmware: the simulator env is the only one that builds
// this directory, and the whole file is behind SIMULATOR anyway.
