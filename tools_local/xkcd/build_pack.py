"""Build the xkcd pack for the SD card.

    tools_local/xkcd/build_pack.py --out fs_agent/xkcd

Downloads every comic's metadata and artwork, converts each to the device's
native 1-bit format at **native size** (never scaled), and writes the three
files the app reads. Both the download cache and the pack are resumable:
interrupt it and run it again.

One objective: never pan on two axes if one will do
---------------------------------------------------
Posture and zoom are chosen together to make that true, and it comes out true
for 97% of the archive. Each of the comic's two dimensions lands in one of
three bands against the device's SHORT (480) and LONG (756) sides, so there are
nine cases and no others; `layout()` is that matrix, and the matrix itself is
drawn in docs/apps/xkcd-pack-format.md.

The scale may fall from the target cap height to the floor -- about a sixth --
when that is what removes a panning axis. That single allowance takes the
archive from 68% to 85% needing no panning at all.

What is stored is the artwork at the size its lettering needs, in the posture
that costs the fewest axes. Comics that pan also carry a small whole-comic
OVERVIEW, reached with OK; only 15% need one, and each is at most a screenful.

Both are built here, on a host, with a real resampling filter before a single
dither. That is the whole reason there is a pack: resampling art that is
already 1-bit is mush, and the device cannot hold the greyscale original.

Why the dither comes from convert.cpp
-------------------------------------
The device converts newly downloaded comics itself with
lib/GfxRenderer/BitmapHelpers.cpp. convert.cpp links that same file, so a comic
from the pack and a comic fetched over wifi go through identical arithmetic.
A Python port would be a second implementation of something no user could ever
be told apart, and it would drift.
