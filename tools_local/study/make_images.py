"""Pack a deck's sentence images into a 1-bit blob the device can blit.

290 of the 301 cards in Mario's deck carry a SentenceImage -- a photograph
illustrating the example sentence. Anki shows it under the answer; the device
could not, because measuring the answer side showed a third of cards leave
under 160px and the tightest leaves nine. So the image is a second view: the
answer offers it, a tap shows it full screen.

That decision is what sets the size here. The image is not squeezed under the
text, it gets the screen, so it is scaled to fit the body rect and dithered
once at conversion time rather than on a device with no floating point to
spare.

Floyd-Steinberg, via PIL's default for mode "1". Photographs dither far better
than type does -- the reader already uses the same approach for book covers, so
this follows a path rather than inventing one.

        --collection ~/…/collection.anki2 --out /Volumes/SDCARD/study/mandarin

Run it after anki_to_deck.py: the card order comes out of the deck's own
cards.dat, so the index can never drift from the notes it belongs to.
