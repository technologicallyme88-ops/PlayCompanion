The format, and the reasoning behind it, is docs/apps/study-deck-format.md. This
script only writes; nothing here reads back from the device. Sync in the other
direction is deck_to_anki.py.

Reading Anki's collection directly (rather than an .apkg export) is deliberate:
the scheduling state and the deck's FSRS parameters only exist in the live
collection, and shipping a deck without them would mean the device scheduling
differently from the phone on the very first review.
