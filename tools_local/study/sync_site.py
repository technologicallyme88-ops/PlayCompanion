"""Pack the study tools into site/study/tools.zip, deterministically.

The installer page runs the repository's own Python tools through Pyodide;
this script is how they get to the site. One zip, byte-stable for identical
inputs (fixed timestamps, sorted names), so `git status` only moves when a
tool really changed.

    python3 tools_local/study/sync_site.py            # write the zip
    python3 tools_local/study/sync_site.py --check    # exit 1 if stale

--check exists for check.sh: a page serving last week's converter while the
CLI has this week's is exactly the drift the Pyodide design is supposed to
make impossible, so staleness has to be loud.
