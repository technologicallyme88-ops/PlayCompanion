"""Replay reviews done on the device back into the Anki collection.

    tools_local/study/deck_to_anki.py \
        /Volumes/SDCARD/study/mandarin \
        ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Anki2/User\\ 1/collection.anki2

This is the half that makes the device an Anki client rather than a toy.
`revlog.dat` is written on the device, one 32-byte record per review, and this
replays each one into `revlog` and updates the card it belongs to.

## Anki MUST be closed

Anki holds the collection open and keeps its own state in memory; writing
underneath it loses whichever copy it flushes last. This script refuses to run
if Anki looks like it is running, and takes a backup before touching anything.

## What it does and does not do

It writes the review history and each card's new due date, interval, and FSRS
memory state -- everything the device computed. It does NOT recompute anything
itself: the device already ran the same FSRS-5 with the same parameters (that
is what host-tests/study pins at 287/301 against this very collection), so
recomputing here would be a second implementation to keep in step.

After importing, Anki may want to rebuild its own caches. "Tools > Check
Database" is harmless and does that.

## Idempotency

Each device review carries the card id and the wall-clock millisecond it was
answered, which is exactly Anki's revlog primary key. Re-running the script
therefore cannot double-apply a review: rows that already exist are skipped.
The device's revlog.dat is left alone -- it is an append-only record, not a
queue, and truncating it would destroy the only copy of that history.
