"""What the installer page calls, and nothing else does.

This is the boundary between the website and the study tools: the worker
imports this one module and calls its three functions, each returning JSON
because that is what crosses the Pyodide bridge cleanly. Everything real
happens in the tools themselves, driven exactly as the CLI drives them
(argv + runpy), so the page cannot grow behavior the CLI does not have.

Paths are fixed: the package lands at /work/deck.apkg, unpacks under
/work/unpacked, and the converted deck is built in /work/deck. One deck at a
time; opening a new package clears the lot.
