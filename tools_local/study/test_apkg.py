"""Prove the .apkg path end to end: export, unwrap, convert, check.

    .venv-study/bin/python tools_local/study/test_apkg.py

Builds fixtures with Anki's own exporter (make_fixture_apkg.py), opens them
with apkg.py, runs anki_to_deck.py on the unwrapped collection, and parses
what came out. Every assertion is counted, and the count is printed, because
"PASS (0 checks)" has bitten this project before.
