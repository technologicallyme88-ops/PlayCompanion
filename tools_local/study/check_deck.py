"""Check every card in a converted deck against the fonts that will draw it.

Rendering one card and looking at it proves that card works. This walks all of
them and asks the questions a screenshot cannot answer at scale:

  * is every codepoint present in **all five** CJK faces? The face is chosen at
    random per card, so a glyph missing from one of them is a card that renders
    correctly four times out of five and as a blank the fifth. That is the
    worst possible failure mode: rare, unreproducible, and indistinguishable
    from a bug in the app.
  * is every codepoint in the Latin fields present in the built-in serif? The
    pinyin carries tone marks, and a missing one is a box in the middle of a
    reading.
  * does the headword fit across the screen at 100px?
  * does the example sentence wrap into a sane number of lines?
  * is any single unbreakable run longer than the renderer's line buffer?

Run it after converting a deck and before trusting it:
