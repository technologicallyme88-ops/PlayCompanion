// PLAY NEARBY, between two browser tabs' worth of firmware.
//
// On the device the radio is ESP-NOW; on Mario's Mac it is UDP on loopback,
// which is how two simulator windows find each other. A browser has neither.
// Two instances of the module are two WebAssembly memories, and the only thing
// that can carry bytes between them is the JavaScript that owns them both.
//
// So this implements linkplay::Radio against a router in site/assets/
// emulator.js. Nothing here is device code and nothing here is reachable from
// a firmware build: LinkRadio.cpp routes to this file only under
// __EMSCRIPTEN__, and this file is only compiled by tools_local/wasm/build.py.
//
// The shape is deliberately the same as the loopback one, because two separate
// decisions read the address and both have to behave here the way they behave
// everywhere else. Each instance claims a slot and the slot becomes the low
// half of its address, so: lowest address wins *peer selection*, which is what
// stops three instances forming a cycle; and the address breaks a tie in *host
// election*, which is otherwise decided by the coin toss in LinkSession. Host
// is deliberately not "lowest address wins" -- see LinkSession.h, where fixed
// MACs meant one device played White in every game forever.
//
// Threads: the firmware runs on a Web Worker and the router lives on the main
// thread. Sends proxy across with MAIN_THREAD_EM_ASM, which blocks the worker
// for the length of one JavaScript call -- at a few packets a second that is
// free, and it removes any question about how long a buffer stays alive.
// Deliveries come the other way: the page calls crossplay_link_deliver on the
// main thread, which writes into the receive ring the worker drains. The ring
// was built for exactly that (an ESP-NOW callback producing, a task consuming)
// and its head and tail are already atomics over shared memory.
