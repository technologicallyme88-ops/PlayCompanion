"""Fit the Toy Battle evaluation to self-play outcomes.

Mario's question, 2026-08-11: chess engines learn without human games, so why
are we hand-tuning heuristics? They do, and this is the version of that which
fits on an ESP32. Play a great many games, record every position with how its
game actually ended, then solve for the weights that best predict the result.
Standard practice in chess engines; the device runs the same search either way
and only gets better numbers.

The weights being replaced -- 400 a medal, 25 a base, 8 a reachable slot, 6 a
rack troop -- were all chosen by eye and never fitted. The tournament could only
RANK variants that shared them, so it ranked depth and could not see the goal.

Logistic regression on win/loss, plain gradient descent, no dependencies: this
has to run anywhere and the problem is eight features wide.
