"""Turn assets_local/dungeons/dungeons.txt into a flash-resident puzzle bank.

The interesting part is not the formatting: it is that this script SOLVES every
puzzle before it emits it, exhaustively, and refuses to write the header unless
each one has exactly one solution.

That matters because a puzzle with two solutions is unplayable in a way no test
of the app could catch -- the player finds a valid arrangement of walls, the
game says no, and nothing anywhere is wrong except the data. Deriving the
answer instead of transcribing it also means the source file cannot disagree
with the header, because there is only one place the answer exists.
